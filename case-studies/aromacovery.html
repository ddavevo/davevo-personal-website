                <h2>College students are booked and busy</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite burnout and sleep deprivation, students work harder than 
                    ever to succeed in a competitive job market after getting their degrees. 
                    For UC San Diego students, the demands of a fast-paced quarter system, 
                    high coursework loads, job hunting, and life obligations pose 
                    significant challenges on learning and personal development.

                    UCSD had invested in MetroNaps™ sleeping pods since 2019 for 
                    students to use at RIMAC, the most popular campus gym.

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Although MetroNaps™ sleeping pods have found success in many 
                    corporate workspaces and recognizable brands like Google and FedEx, our 
                    exploratory field research at RIMAC found that they are not effectively helping 
                    students rest because:

                <h3>Solution Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We redesigned the sleeping pods to enhance rest quality by 
                    making the space easier to maintain and the sleeping 
                    experience more pleasant, improving workout recovery for gym-goers and 
                    expanding usage to support students overcome burnout & improve 
                    academic performance.

                <p>
                    After gaining some initial insights about the sleeping pods, I decided to conduct online research to deepen my understanding of self-sufficient public spaces, workout recovery, and academic burnout. Here is what we learned:

                        <p>When people wait for someone else to act instead (in this case, a cleaning staff member), the experience becomes less satisfactory for everyone if nobody steps up.</p>

                <h3>Primary Research</h3>
                <p>
                    We conducted 13 interviews with <b>gym-goers, gym staff, and the 
                        general student body</b> to learn more about their respective pain 
                    points and what could be done better.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    The user interviews were either scheduled over Zoom or done on-site at the gym or at popular study spots. After coding the data, here is what we learned:

                    Based on the data we've gathered, we created user personas to distill our findings in order to understand the background, goals, and obstacles of both current gym-goers and the potential general student body.

                <p>
                    1. How might we encourage users to take care of the sleeping pods and ensure that existing and potential users enjoy using them?

                <p>
                    2. How might the sleeping pods facilitate better rest quality and boost productivity for students after using them?

                <p>
                    3. How might we make the sleeping pods more accessible for students across campus?

                <h3>User Flow</h3>
                <p>
                    Since our users are going to be stressed or fatigued when using the interface, we prioritized ease of use when designing the user flow.

                <h3>Paper Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    To test the user flows, I quickly drafted rough screens from paper. Then, we conducted preliminary user testing by having participants walk through the features. Here’s what we discovered:

                        <p><b>Too many steps</b></p>
                        <p>Users felt like the process was too complicated and pointed out how annoying it would be as a returning user, having to go through that process each time.</p>

                        <p>Certain icons and selections were not intuitive, like how some users were confused about how to increase/decrease the timer.</p>

                        <p>The timer counting down should not be so prominent on the resting screen, as the participants associate it with deadlines, exactly what they’re trying to get away from!</p>

                <h3>How We Iterated</h3>

                <p>We first prioritized reducing the total number of actions required to get to the rest stage, resulting in half as many.</p>

                <p>And here is how we iterated upon the visual layout of the screens.</p>

                <h3>Conceptual Rendering</h3>
                <p>
                    Given the limited resources that are available to us, we cannot easily replicate the sophisticated MetroNaps™ build, so we decided to simulate the space to prototype the experience (#1-3).

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, #4-5 are our new additions to the sleeping pod to enhance rest quality (#4) and provide a sustainable method of maintaining the space (#5).

                <p>
                    No two places have the same people or the same user needs. There needs to be more consideration for how the sleeping pods are set up and maintained when transported to public settings in order to deliver an accessible, enjoyable sleeping experience.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    It's very clear that these sleeping pods have the power to improve the recovery experience beyond the campus gym at UCSD. And so, more usability testing could be done with Aromacovery to expand its use cases to cater to a wider pool of needs, whether at the office, the library, or anywhere someone would need to <b>rejuvenate, restore, and resume</b> their activities.
