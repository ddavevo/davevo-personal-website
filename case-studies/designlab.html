                        It's true. They're not just accelerating productivity, but redefining how ideas are produced and refined altogether.
                        Embedding these features directly into the workflow can reduce friction and spark new directions for creative problem-solving.

                        Especially for creative work, today’s first pick might not be the same a year from now. Let's look at image generation for example: first it was DALL-E, then Midjourney took over, and now Adobe Firefly is built right into the Adobe Suite.

                    <p>
                        Tools come and go fast, and creatives have learned to be more selective with their toolkit. Adopting a tool means changing habits, workflows, and sometimes even their creative voice.

                        AI has to help people nurture their creativity instead of providing a shortcut to it. For this reason, it's risky to only be concerned with AI performance or user satisfaction.
                    <p>
                        While so many evaluations focus on outputs, fewer study how the <i>structure</i> of user-AI interaction shapes the experience in terms of cognitive engagement and creative depth.

                        To explore the role of structure (the timing and placement of AI support), we looked at integrating an LLM into design templates, a well-established strategy for guiding creative problem solving. This provides us a tangible way of observing how people think and develop creative ideas.

                        Sometimes, the best interface is no interface. We realized these previous users struggled to act on AI insights because they were disconnected from where the work happened. Instead, we decided the easiest approach was to revise the backend to generate shorter, more targeted insights.

                        From a research perspective, this also gave us more chances to see how users actually synthesized and applied AI input, rather than just skimming it.

                        In addition to populating dimensions, we explored letting users auto-generate entire rows for new competitors.
                        The idea was to see whether giving users a full view of a single competitor might shift how they approach comparisons or structure their analysis.

                            We realized this risked over-structuring the competitor at once, turning it into a one-by-one review of each (just like the old plugin) instead of encouraging comparison and synthesis.

                        Users found it hard to explore beyond the AI’s suggestions because they seemed complete and convincing. And so, they spent more time deciding on their idea’s direction, leaving less room for depth and creativity.

                        The patterns we saw in our study echoed a broader trend in today’s AI tools.

                        Much of the market still leans into one of two extremes:
                    </p>
                    <div class="insight with-emoji">
                        <span>1️⃣</span>

                            <p>
                                 AI-Led users synthesized the most ideas, but this may leave users preemptively satisfied at the first few convincing ideas rather than staying curious to develop them further.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Co-Led users balanced exposure to new ideas with agency. But AI that only reacts to user input can be limiting at times — especially if the user get stuck or leaves their own assumptions unspoken.

                        Even after we submitted the paper, I couldn’t stop wondering what an answer could look like. I decided to put myself in the shoes of someone working on an AI tool, perhaps my goal now is to take our current plugin and improve it even further.

                        After filling out a few spreads, these were some of the themes that emerged from my ideation. They tie back to the gaps we saw in the study: users feeling boxed in, feeling stuck, needing a bit more help for instance. All while keeping it lightweight and leveraging AI's flexibility.

                        During this process, I bumped into some of the risks of making AI proactive. Too invasive and users will tune it out, too heavy-handed and you’ll flatten their process. Striking the right balance matters.

                    <p>
                        I went with these two since they’re lightweight enough not to overwhelm, can gently nudge the user at the right moments, and can draw on the template’s context to offer relevant, well-timed insights or tips.

                        The turning point came when we reframed them not as “words” and “numbers,” but as reflections of “what participants thought” and “what they did.”

                        Rather than beginning with thought processes and searching for matching behaviors, we started with statistically significant behaviors and traced them back to supporting quotes.

                    <p>
                    This clarified the <i>why</i> behind users’ actions and gave us a clearer lens to explain the various effects on their thinking.

                        In a pre-survey, we asked users if they had any design thinking background. Then, experts blindly rated user responses across Likert-scale benchmarks, which we graphed against experience levels.

                    <p>
                        We initially anticipated a clear correlation—but the data suggested something more complex.

                        Yet in their interview, they demonstrated clear signs of deep reflection: they questioned the AI’s logic, merged multiple ideas, and grounded their decisions in a human-centered way.

                        Cases like those highlighted a key nuance in evaluating creativity: strong thinking isn’t always neatly packaged.

                        This further drove our final thesis, saying that AI tools should go beyond generating outputs. Instead, they should anchor their value propositions in providing structures for nuanced thinking and fluid ways to elevate their creative workflows.

                        I thought research was only about pushing the envelope and finding novelty. Over these 10 months, I realized that results only matter if they reflect something about us, the people who use and get influenced by this type of technology.

                        It’s no secret that academic research demands rigor and many hats to be worn. While it took time to get up to speed with the literature and methods, the biggest lesson was staying present, being a self-starter, and staying hungry for more.

                        Academic research meant the ceiling is high and felt hard to reach on my own. For me, the most invalubale part was getting advice from all the researchers I met, so I wish I had taken more chances to accelerate my growth by looping in more perspectives whenever I hit different stages or hurdles.
