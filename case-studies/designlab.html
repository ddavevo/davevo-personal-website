                        As AI becomes more embedded in creativity, it’s crucial to understand not just what AI can do, but how its positioning within workflows influences how we engage with the creative process itself.

                        To explore an alternative approach for interacting with AI tools, we looked at integrating an LLM into design templates, a well-established strategy for helping users think, organize information, and reflect on creative work.

                    <p>
                        The initial plugin had these AI-generated Q&As to prompt reflection. However, previous participants felt like they were repetitive summaries without offering specific angles or concrete ways to explore a competitor further.

                        To address this issue, the backend was revised so that the AI generated shorter, more targeted responses—highlighting specific advantages, weaknesses, or insights.

                        Previously, there was no smooth handoff between reading AI insights and applying them. Users were often left unsure of what to do next, breaking their momentum instead of advancing their analysis.

                        To observe how users perceived AI-generated content, the previous plugin allowed them to mark any generated material for validity. But most skipped this feature since it felt like an extra task that interrupted their workflow, taking time away from research and synthesis.

                        If the participant isn’t selecting an element in the template, the plugin defaults to an idle screen that suggests next steps for exploration.
                        Due to how non-linear the exercise is, we wanted to prevent decision paralysis by offering possible actions to keep them actively engaged.

                        The idea was to see whether giving users a full view of a single competitor might shift how they approach comparisons or structure their analysis.

                        Users found it hard to explore beyond the AI’s suggestions because they seemed complete and convincing. And so, they spent more time deciding on their idea’s direction, leaving less room for depth and creativity.

                                 AI-Led users synthesized the most ideas, but this may leave users preemptively satisfied at the first few convincing ideas rather than staying curious to develop them further.

                        After submitting the paper, I spent time reflecting on how our insights might help AI tools better position its value. 
                        Through sketching out various concepts, I explored several avenues for supporting users in creative thinking:

                        Our research process began with coding timestamps for key task activities and running thematic analyses on user interviews responses to pinpoint patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we initially struggled to build a cohesive, data-driven narrative—partly because we were treating qualitative and quantitative data as separate silos.

                        The turning point came when we reframed them not as “words” and “numbers,” but as reflections of “what participants thought” and “what they did.”

                        Rather than beginning with thought processes and searching for matching behaviors, we started with statistically significant behaviors and traced them back to supporting quotes.

                    <p>
                    This clarified the <i>why</i> behind users’ actions and gave us a clearer lens to explain the various effects on their thinking.

                        In a pre-survey, we asked users if they had any design thinking background. Then, experts blindly rated user responses across Likert-scale benchmarks, which we graphed against experience levels.

                    <p>
                        We initially anticipated a clear correlation—but the data suggested something more complex.

                    <p>
                        Most expert ratings aligned with the quality of the participants’ solutions—but a few outliers reminded us that strong ideas don’t always look polished.

                    <p>
                        One participant, for instance, proposed a loosely structured solution around adaptive cultural change in education. Experts blindly rated their solution low in several areas due to the lack of “how” this solution would be implemented and “how” this affects its audience.

                        This further drove our final thesis, saying that AI tools should go beyond generating outputs. Instead, they should anchor their value propositions in providing structures for nuanced thinking and seamless ways to trace their thinking process.

                        It’s no secret that academic research demands rigor and many hats to be worn. While it took time to get up to speed with the literature and methods, the biggest lesson was staying present, being a self-starter, and staying hungry for more.

                        Academic research meant the ceiling is high and felt hard to reach on my own. For me, the most invalubale part was getting advice from all the researchers I met, so I wish I had taken more chances to accelerate my growth by looping in more perspectives whenever I hit different stages or hurdles.
