                        Something I learned in the process of defining the methodology is ensuring we’re not analyzing the tool’s performance, but rather <b>the effects</b> the tool has on the users.

                        We were curious how the plugin influenced the process, using literature-backed metrics and frameworks that assess reflective thinking, creativity, and usability.

                        Our research process began with coding timestamps for key task activities and running thematic analyses on user interviews responses to pinpoint patterns.

                    <p>
                        However, we initially struggled to build a cohesive, data-driven narrative—partly because we were treating qualitative and quantitative data as separate silos.

                        The turning point came when we reframed them not as “words” and “numbers,” but as reflections of “what participants thought” and “what they did.”

                        Rather than beginning with thought processes and searching for matching behaviors, we started with statistically significant behaviors and traced them back to supporting quotes.

                        In a pre-survey, we asked users if they had any design thinking background. Then, experts blindly rated user responses across Likert-scale benchmarks, which we graphed against experience levels.

                    We were surprised to see that there’s no strong correlation. But that’s when we realized something:

                        Some may associate higher word counts with more developed ideas, but others may see wordy responses as fluff. Or some may find a solution with multiple ideas as multi-faceted while others may think it feels scattered and lacks direction.
