                        Before understanding how AI should be adopted into these tools, we first need to understand people’s workflows with AI. Like how they use it in creative settings, or what they are trying to achieve with it, and what’s currently stopping them.

                        To explore an alternative approach for interacting with AI tools, we looked at integrating an LLM into design templates, a well-established strategy for helping users think, organize information, and reflect on creative work.

                        For our interviews and surveys, we were curious how the plugin shaped their thinking and creative outcomes, using literature-backed metrics and frameworks that assess reflective thinking, creativity, and usability.

                        The initial plugin had these AI-generated Q&As to prompt reflection. However, previous participants felt like they were repetitive summaries without offering specific angles or concrete ways to explore a competitor further.

                        To address this issue, the backend was revised so that the AI generated shorter, more targeted responses—highlighting specific advantages, weaknesses, or insights. This made the content easier to act on and, from a research standpoint, gave us more opportunities to observe how users synthesized and applied AI input, rather than just skimming through it.

                        To address this, we expanded the interface to include guidance screens for every interactive element in the table, not just competitor headers or add-buttons. These screens provide lightweight context on what each element is, how users can interact with it, and what role it plays in the overall exercise, keeping exploration fluid without defining a fixed path.

                        To observe how users perceived AI-generated content, the previous plugin allowed them to mark any generated material for validity. But most skipped this feature since it felt like an extra task that interrupted their workflow, taking time away from research and synthesis.

                        We decided to not move forward with this feature and instead embedded simple, contextual language like “Review and edit if needed” or “This may or may not reflect your own analysis.” This subtly encourages reflection without pulling users out of the task.

                        If the participant isn’t selecting an element in the template, the plugin defaults to an idle screen that suggests next steps for exploration.
                        Due to how non-linear the exercise is, we wanted to prevent decision paralysis by offering possible actions to keep them actively engaged.

                        In addition to populating dimensions, we explored letting users auto-generate entire rows for new competitors.
                        The idea was to see whether giving users a full view of a single competitor might shift how they approach comparisons or structure their analysis.

                    <p>
                        Our research process began with coding timestamps for key task activities and running thematic analyses on user interviews responses to pinpoint patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we initially struggled to build a cohesive, data-driven narrative—partly because we were treating qualitative and quantitative data as separate silos.

                    <p>
                        The turning point came when we reframed them not as “words” and “numbers,” but as reflections of “what participants thought” and “what they did.”

                    <p>
                        Rather than beginning with thought processes and searching for matching behaviors, we started with statistically significant behaviors and traced them back to supporting quotes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This clarified the <i>why</i> behind users’ actions and gave us a clearer lens to explain the various effects on their thinking.

                    <p>
                        In a pre-survey, we asked users if they had any design thinking background. Then, experts blindly rated user responses across Likert-scale benchmarks, which we graphed against experience levels. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    We were surprised to see that there’s no strong correlation. But that’s when we realized something:

                        When you take the users’ solutions away from where the learning took place, others can’t see why certain choices were made.

                    <p>
                        Some may associate higher word counts with more developed ideas, but others may see wordy responses as fluff. Or some may find a solution with multiple ideas as multi-faceted while others may think it feels scattered and lacks direction.

                        That’s why our final thesis argues that AI tools should go beyond generating outputs and instead help users reflect, trace their thinking, and make their process more seamless.

                        I thought research was only about pushing the envelope and finding novelty. Over these 10 months, I realized that results only matter if they reflect something about us, the people who use and get influenced by this type of technology.

                        It’s no secret that academic research demands rigor and many hats to be worn. While it took time to get up to speed with the literature and methods, the biggest lesson was staying present, being a self-starter, and staying hungry for more.

                        I navigated the highs and lows of HCI research using the limited methods I knew at the time.  While we got there in the end, I’ve since realized how valuable it would be to actively seek mentorship from more academics.
