                        To explore an alternative approach for interacting with AI tools, we looked at integrating an LLM into design templates, a well-established strategy for helping users think, organize information, and reflect on creative work.

                        Something I learned in the process of defining the methodology is ensuring we’re not analyzing the tool’s performance, but rather <b>the effects</b> the tool has on the users.

                    <p>
                        At its core, we were curious how the plugin shaped their thinking and creative outcomes, using literature-backed metrics and frameworks that assess reflective thinking, creativity, and usability.

                        No-AI participants generated fewer topic categories but did the most self-revision, spending more time refining half-baked ideas. They had a strong understanding of the problem, rated their solutions as more creative, and expressed higher confidence by thinking deeply without outside help.

                    <p>
                        Co-Led participants rated their initial solutions as creative, drawing new perspectives through guided reflection rather than relying on AI content. While they explored more topics than No-AI, they rated their iterated solutions as less competitive in the market, focusing more on realistic constraints than novelty.

                        AI-Led participants covered the most topic categories in their iterated solutions, given immediate access to AI-generated information. However, they struggled to form new perspectives, made the fewest edits, and required more time to narrow down their solution’s scope, resulting in lower creativity ratings.

                        Problem-solving is a swinging pendulum between gathering information, revising earlier ideas, and creating new ones.

                        Users found it hard to explore beyond the AI’s suggestions because they seemed complete and convincing. As a result, they needed much more time to digest the templates before making a decision on their idea’s direction.

                    <p>
                    And due to the AI’s perceived comprehensiveness, some users even accepted surface-level ideas without fully questioning them.

                    <p>
                        Our research process began with coding timestamps for key task activities and running thematic analyses on user interviews responses to pinpoint patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we initially struggled to build a cohesive, data-driven narrative—partly because we were treating qualitative and quantitative data as separate silos.

                        The turning point came when we reframed them not as “words” and “numbers,” but as reflections of “what participants thought” and “what they did.”

                        Rather than beginning with thought processes and searching for matching behaviors, we started with statistically significant behaviors and traced them back to supporting quotes.

                    <p>
                    This clarified the <i>why</i> behind users’ actions and gave us a clearer lens to explain the various effects on their thinking.

                    <p>
                        In a pre-survey, we asked users if they had any design thinking background. Then, experts blindly rated user responses across scaling benchmarks, which we graphed against experience levels. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    We were surprised to see that there’s no strong correlation. But that’s when we realized something:

                    <p>
                        When you take the users’ solutions away from where the learning took place, others can’t see why certain choices were made.

                    <p>
                        Some may associate higher word counts with more developed ideas, but others may see wordy responses as fluff. Or some may find a solution with multiple ideas as multi-faceted while others may think it feels scattered and lacks direction.

                        That’s why our final thesis argues that AI tools should go beyond generating outputs and instead help users reflect, trace their thinking, and make their process more seamless. That’s the real value.

                <p>
                    I thought research was only about pushing the envelope and finding novelty. Over these 10 months, I realized that results only matter if they reflect something about us, the people who use and get influenced by this type of technology. Data-driven storytelling is just as important as knowing how to wrangle information together.

                <p>
                    It’s no secret that academic research demands rigor and many hats to be worn. While it took time to get up to speed with the literature and methods, the biggest lesson was staying present, being a self-starter, and staying hungry for more.

                    I navigated the highs and lows of HCI research using the limited methods I knew at the time.  While we got there in the end, I’ve since realized how valuable it would be to actively seek mentorship from more academics.
