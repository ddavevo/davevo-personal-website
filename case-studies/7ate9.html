                <p>
                    Needless to say, TikTok opens up many doors for small businesses to thrive.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Due to the personal and authentic feel of the platform, <b>public trust has become more important than ever</b> for food recommendations. This is especially seen through food personalities like Keith Lee, as millions admire him for "keeping it real" in the food space.
                </p><br>

                <p class="subtitle">Problem</p>
                <h3>Virality is not the same as visibility</h3><br>
                <h4>Business POV</h4>
                <p>
                    TikTok doesn't necessarily make running a small business any easier, especially for <b>home kitchens</b>, often overlooked and left behind. With less staff, they usually have to wear multiple hats to run their business. For them, <b>social media skills are a nice-to-have</b> rather than a necessity.
                </p>
                <div class="white-space-block"></div>

                <h4>Customer POV</h4>
                <p>
                    And even though home businesses aren't a new wave on TikTok, the infrastructure simply isn't there to help customers discover vetted home kitchens on their own (whereas small food businesses have more established means of promoting).
                </p>
                <div class="white-space-block"></div>

                <h3>7Ate9, ready to dine!</h3>
                <p>
                    The 7Ate9 app encourages friends to connect with small businesses and home kitchens they haven't tried before, lowering the barriers for customers to discover and for businesses to grow.

                <h3>Running a feature audit</h3>
                <p>
                    To dive deeper into what makes small businesses tick, I decided to cross-compare various features across current competitors in the market and relevant prototypes in academic literature to scope out how tools can shape social eating and business growth.
                </p><br>
                <img src="https://media.dave-vo.com/file/dvfolio/789/research-audit.png">
                <div class="white-space-block"></div>

                <p>
                    As seen above, there is a strong distinction between tools/platforms that drive social engagement vs. those that support business management.
                </p><br>
                <div class="insight">
                    <div>
                        <p><b>How the two impact consumer behaviors</b></p>
                        <p>
                            When its focus is engagement, people emotionally invest into the brand. And when it‚Äôs the latter, the infrastructure makes the product more accessible, growing the audience while keeping existing patrons satisfied.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div><br>

                <p>
                    This is further supported by the literature, which points to two key factors:
                </p><br>
                <div class="insight">
                    <div>
                        <p><b>Community presence beyond the meal</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Food is the facilitator, but social interactions that feel personal are the glue to longer relationships. For the food business, that could lead to more customer loyalty.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div>
                        <p><b>Social before technological</b></p>
                        <p>
                            To foster trust, technology should serve as the ‚Äúinvitation‚Äù rather than be the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù to try something new and local. It‚Äôs important for it to feel authentic.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div><br>

                <p>
                    While we did find platforms that included most of the features we mapped onto the audit, it's a matter of how they are executed. And so, we identified opportunities that we could explore further.

                            Many examples showcased 1-to-1 interactions, meaning little exploration has been done on scaling relationships to local networks.

                <p>
                    For the last leg of this project, we needed to prototype a proof-of-concept. Due to the time constraints, I decided to map the features on an <b>MVP priority matrix</b> to determine which ones we should focus on.

                            For home kitchens, delivery is a more manual process. 7Ate9 provides more efficient ways to keep track of delivery details to <b>prevent getting lost in transaction</b>.

                <h2>Why are local food businesses and home kitchens important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike large food chains, small food businesses provide a stronger outlet for community and culture. Authenticity has been given more weight in recent years, and based on prevalent internet discourse and our research, it‚Äôs clear that ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù food is a vehicle for both human connection and marketing.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    As people are looking toward community and compelling voices to inform their decisions, trust becomes a critical asset to foster customer loyalty and to drive a diverse, lucrative market in the food industry.

                <p class="subtitle">And what did I learn?</p>
                <h3>Be prepared to be unprepared</h3>
                <p>
                    With so many variables at play, curveballs can come from just about anywhere. When it was necessary to fall back, I learned to use the opportunity to revise the delivery and come back with a more concise message that connected with people.
                </p>
                <div class="white-space-block"></div>

                <h3>Lead when there‚Äôs an opening</h3>
                <p>
                    Even though I wasn‚Äôt the official PM, I helped shape the trajectory of the design process. By documenting everyone‚Äôs ideas when nobody else did and taking the initiative on making the MVP prototype, our team got feedback quicker, which added up in the end result.
