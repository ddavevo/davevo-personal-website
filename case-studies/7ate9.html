                <h2>The Marketing Power of FoodTok</h2>
                <p>
                    As a marketing tool, TikTok offers small restaurants and home kitchens the opportunity to reach new audiences and attract more customers through sudden spikes in virality.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Due to the personal and authentic feel of the platform, public trust has become more important than ever for food recommendations. ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù voices can be quite powerful. We can see this through Keith Lee‚Äôs popularity, as millions are tuning in so that they can filter out the hidden gems from overrated and pricey places.
                </p>
                <div class="white-space-block"></div>

                <h3>Virality is not the same as visibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Since small businesses often have to wear multiple hats to run their kitchens, social media skills are a nice-to-have rather than a necessity. And so they may not have the tech-savvy or knowledge of current internet trends to promote themselves effectively.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Despite being exposed to more options, customers still find it hard to discover small businesses on their own since online feeds don't always show places locally.
                </p>
                <div class="white-space-block"></div>

                <h3>Solution Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The 7Ate9 app encourages people to try new places with friends and connect with the chefs while easing business management and promotion for local food joints along the way.

                <h2>Exploring the dynamic between social eating and trust</h2>
                <p>
                    To dive deeper into what makes small businesses tick, I decided to perform competitive analysis and literature research to scope out how these businesses are catered to and how technology is used in the context of social eating.
                </p><br><br>

                <h3>Here's what we learned:</h3><br>

                <div class="insight">
                    <div>
                        <p><b>Localization</b></p>
                        <p>
                            People feel a stronger sense of community through localized promotion because it provides familiarity and emotional connection.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="insight">
                    <div>
                        <p><b>Social before technological</b></p>
                        <p>
                            To foster trust, technology should enhance rather than dominate the eating experience, serving as the ‚Äúinvitation‚Äù rather than the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù to try something new and local.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="insight">

                        <p>
                            Social interactions that feel lively and personable correlate to having longer-lasting contact. For the food business, that could lead to more customer loyalty.
                        </p>

                            Several existing platforms facilitate 1-to-1 interactions, meaning little exploration has been done on scaling relationships between customer and business in the food industry.

                            These platforms are reliant on location tagging, which poses potential safety issues for customers, especially when taken to the local level.

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>
                    To better understand customers‚Äô relationships with buying food and small restaurants‚Äô perspectives with running their business, we conducted a customer survey of <b>47 respondents</b> and conducted <b>11 interviews</b> with customers and business owners.

                <h2>Why are local food businesses and home kitchens important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike large food chains, small food businesses provide a stronger outlet for community and culture. Authenticity has been given more weight in recent years, and based on prevalent internet discourse and our research, it‚Äôs clear that ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù food is a vehicle for both human connection and marketing.

                <p>
                    As people are looking toward community and compelling voices to inform their decisions, trust becomes a critical asset to foster customer loyalty and to drive a diverse, lucrative market in the food industry.
